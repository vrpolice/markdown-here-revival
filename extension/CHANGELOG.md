# Changelog

## [4.0.17]

### Fixed
- Preview pane now maintains its width ratio when the compose window is resized
- Signature content no longer flickers when dragging the splitter left
  (MutationObserver was treating the record array as a single object, so
  attribute-change filtering never worked)

### Changed
- Extension ID changed to `markdown-here-revival@vrpolice.github.io` to
  avoid conflict with the upstream ATN listing
- Options page branding updated: footer credits, bug report link, license
  summary all point to this fork
- Author displays as plain text (no hyperlink) in Add-ons Manager

## [4.0.16]

### Fixed
- Options page "Basic CSS" was empty due to missing CHANGELOG.md in extension
  bundle causing a NetworkError that aborted page initialization
- Added error handling to changelog loader so a fetch failure does not block
  the rest of the options page

### Changed
- Updated authorship and homepage URL to this fork
- LICENSE now includes all three generations of copyright holders

## [4.0.15]

### Changed
- Overhaul default email CSS for a clean, professional business style:
  refined typography with system font stack, lighter heading borders,
  GitHub-style code blocks, subtle zebra-striped tables with header
  background, and softer blockquote styling

## [4.0.14]

### Fixed
- Splitter divider line between Markdown editor and preview pane was invisible
  in Thunderbird 151 ESR due to missing `--splitter-color` CSS variable
- Default preview panel width is now centered (50% of window) instead of
  fixed 650px, calculated fresh per compose window
- "Reset Preview" now correctly resets splitter to centered position

## [4.0.13]

### Changed
- Update `strict_max_version` to `151.*` to support Thunderbird 151 ESR

## [4.0.12]

### Fixed
- MDHR was not working with Thunderbird 148.0 and up. Thank you Cliff Brake for
  tracking down the problems and providing fixes.

## [4.0.10] (unreleased)

## [4.0.9.1]

### New
- Add option to use Body Text format in composer. Body Text is the preferred

  not render correctly with Paragraph mode.

### Fixed
- Math rendering was always enabled (Thanks Sarke!)
- Disable preview update prior to sending to prevent flash of double-rendered
  content in the preview pane

  the overall message size down in long threads and improve performance.
- Improve markdown rendering when composing in "paragraph mode" to reduce
  empty vertical space

### Changed
- Refactored dynamic imports out of the composescript.
- Remove fuse.js dependency

### [4.0 beta 19]

## [4.0 beta 18]

## New

- Emoji autocomplete popup thingy

## [4.0 beta 17]

### Changed

- Update Marked to 12.0.2, update Marked extensions, Turndown, Highlightjs

### Fixed

- Disable MDHR for plain text messages. Fixes #84.

## [4.0 beta 16]

### Fixed

- Replying to plain text or "body text" formatted emails lost inline reply content #85.
- Suppress quirks mode warnings in console log

## [4.0 beta 15]

### Fixed

- Fix up modern mode after using classic mode. #77
- Add a "Reset Preview" item to the compose action context menu. 
- Automate release workflow as much as possible.

## [4.0 beta 14]

### Fixed

- Fix handling of multiple images.  #76.
- Custom CSS styles did not apply to emails. #83.

### Changed

- Live preview: Move external (reply quotes and forwards) content into a shadow
  root'd div to prevent CSS style collision. The shadow root is removed after
  markdown CSS is inlined prior to sending.
- CSS Inliner now operates off a blank document when setting up the default
  styles.
- The CSP `<meta>` element used in the preview pane was previously left in-tact
  when the message was finally sent. It is now removed prior to sending. The
  CSP is intentionally restrictive; among other things it prevents loading
  remote images and CSS. I may create a way to loosen this up a bit for users
  who want remote images and such. In any case, the CSP really does not need to
  be applied in the recipient's email client. I'm not even sure it would be in
  most cases anyway.
- Removed some other miscellaneous stylesheets applied to the preview pane that
  are not needed when the recipient reads an email.
- Live preview iframe now loads from a srcdoc: string. This allows setting the
  default markdown and highlighter CSS as `<style>` elements right away. This
  should reduce cases of unstyled or unrendered messages in the preview.

## [4.0 beta 13]

### Fixed

- Fixed saving boolean (checkbox) options
- Fixed restoring preview width
- Resized images are resized in output as well
- Remove "save markdown source as attachment" option
- Force options preview to rerender when options change

## [4.0 beta 12]

### Fixed

- "Classic" mode now works (I hope)
- Compose Action icon is now purple when in preview (Classic) or if
  markdown mode is active (modern)
- QuickText workaround that may or may not work
- Save markdown source as attachment text/markdown

## [4.0 beta 11]

### Fixed

- Fix Settings page opening multiple tabs
- Save open compose windows as drafts when installing or switching UI modes
  to prevent lost messages - upgrades while messages are being composed may
  continue to be a problem

## [4.0 beta 10]

### Fixed

- Preview width was not saved [#67](https://gitlab.com/jfx2006/markdown-here-revival/-/issues/67)

- Test code fixes

### Known Issues

- Conflict with QuickText extension [#70](https://gitlab.com/jfx2006/markdown-here-revival/-/issues/70)

## [4.0]

- Live Preview (aka "modern") mode is the default
- "Classic" mode is a work in progress to restore the old behavior of the
  render button
- Many refactorings to bring dependencies up to date and use ESM syntax
